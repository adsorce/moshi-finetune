# Recording Script for Context-Free STT Number Training

## Overview

This script provides **200 number sequences** for context-free training. You'll record ONLY the numbers (no context words like "order", "phone", "location").

**Goal:** Train the model to transcribe digit sequences as word-form numerals to prevent VAD cut-offs.

## Recording Instructions

### Setup
- **Microphone:** Use AirPods or best available mic
- **Environment:** Quiet space (some background noise is okay)
- **Format:** The recording script will auto-convert to mono 16kHz WAV
- **Duration:** Each sample will be 2-8 seconds

### How to Speak

**Natural chunking for phone numbers (10 digits):**
- Say: "two one two [brief pause] five five five [brief pause] one two three four"
- NOT: "twoonetwofivenumberfivenumberfive..." (too fast, no pauses)

**For other numbers:**
- Speak at normal conversational pace
- Clear pronunciation of each digit
- Natural rhythm (don't sound robotic)

**Always say "zero" (never "oh"):**
- ✓ "five zero five"
- ✗ "five oh five"

### Variation Guidelines

**Across all 200 samples, vary:**
- **Speed:** Some fast, some slow, mostly normal
- **Tone:** Casual, formal, questioning, flat
- **Pausing:** Some with clear pauses, some continuous
- **Pitch:** High, low, monotone

**Specific instructions are marked in samples:**
- **(pause)** = brief 0.3s pause
- **(fast)** = speak quickly
- **(slow)** = speak deliberately
- **(casual)** = relaxed tone

## Sample Distribution

- **Samples 1-80:** 10-digit phone numbers (NYC/NJ area codes)
- **Samples 81-140:** 7-digit order numbers
- **Samples 141-180:** 6-digit location codes
- **Samples 181-200:** 5-digit zip codes

**Note on repeated digits:** ~30% of samples include repeated digits (555, 777, 888) because these are HARDER for VAD and common in real usage.

## After Recording: Processing Steps

1. **Run the recording script** - It will auto-convert to mono 16kHz
2. **Create dataset index** - Option 4 in recording script
3. **Run Whisper transcription** - Option 5 in recording script
4. **Convert to context-free** - Run: `python convert_transcriptions.py`
5. **Validate dataset** - Run: `python validate_context_free.py`
6. **Start training!**

## Expected Transcription Format

After conversion, your JSON files should contain ONLY digit words:

```json
{
  "alignments": [
    [
      "two one two five five five one two three four",
      [0.0, 3.2],
      "SPEAKER_MAIN"
    ]
  ]
}
```

**All context words will be automatically stripped by `convert_transcriptions.py`!**

## Tips for Success

✅ **Do:**
- Speak naturally and clearly
- Vary your pace and tone across samples
- Use the pausing markers for phone numbers
- Take breaks every 50 samples
- Record in batches (50 samples per session)

❌ **Don't:**
- Rush through all 200 in one sitting
- Speak robotically or too perfectly
- Ignore the speed/tone markers
- Say "oh" instead of "zero"
- Add context words (they'll be removed anyway)

**Total recording time: ~15-20 minutes of audio, spread across 2-4 sessions**

Good luck! 🎤
